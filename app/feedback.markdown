Jordan to BW
Keeping others accountable on things they wanted to work on...be more to the point when situation calls for it.
Didn't bring personal problems into the team dynamic
Don't sell self short - believe in self
Be willing to butt heads more often for the longterm vision


BW to Jordan
Good long term vision - 2 days out
Enthusiasm carried team
Use vision to focus on proj mgt skills - Keeping track of the pieces and how they are going to need to fit together

Both could have done a better job keeping Charissa in the loop and involved on some of the bigger tasks
